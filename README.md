# Assignment-2-Python

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd 
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

#Logic to solve

It asks the user to enter a number.

It checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator %.

If remainder is 0 (a % 2 == 0), it means the number is even.

Otherwise, it is odd.

It prints whether the number is even or odd.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

#logic to solve

What this program does:
It starts with count = 0 (this is where the total sum will be stored).

It uses a for loop to go through every number from 1 to 50 (including 1 and 50).

Inside the loop:

It adds each number to count.

After the loop ends, it prints the final sum.

✅ How it works step-by-step:

First, count = 0

Add 1 → count = 1

Add 2 → count = 3

Add 3 → count = 6

... keeps adding till 50

Final result = 1275
